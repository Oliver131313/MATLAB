# This is a description file to the project
Code focuses on simulation of current (at all times) season results and resulting ranking of teams. 
The reason for impletenting the simulation in MATLAB is that it is a part of an university course assignment. 

1. Scraping data to obtain results of PL matches from past seasons from fbref.com
2. Data are aggregated are prepared in Python
3. MATLAB file calls .py files to obtain updated data for PL results and performs simulations>
  i. Simulation of final ranking for whole season based on data from the (most recent) past season
  ii. Simulation of up-to-date (preliminary) rankings from the past season
  iii. Simulation of final ranking using played matches from current and the past season
